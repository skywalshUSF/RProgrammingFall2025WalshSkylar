#Module #4 post for my LIS4370 blog. Welcome!

#Task 1 - Data Preparation and Cleaning

#Define each vector in R, converting categorical strings to numeric codes
#(bad=1,good=0) (low=0,high=1) and handling NA's appropriately:

Frequency<-c(0.6,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.3,0.4,0.9,0.2)
BloodPressure<-c(103,87,32,42,59,109,78,205,135,176)
FirstAssess<-c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,1) ##(bad=1,good=0)
SecondAssess<-c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1) ##(low=0,high=1)
FinalDecision<-c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1) ##(low=0,high=1)

df_hosp<-data.frame(Frequency,BloodPressure,FirstAssess,SecondAssess,FinalDecision,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Inspect and handle NA's
summary(df_hosp)
df_hosp<-na.omit(df_hosp)

#Task 2 - Generate Basic Visualizations

# A. Side-by-Side Boxplots
boxplot(BloodPressure~FirstAssess,data = df_hosp,names = c("Good","Bad"),ylab = "Blood Pressure",main = "BP by First MD Assessment")
boxplot(BloodPressure~SecondAssess,data = df_hosp,names = c("Low","High"),ylab = "Blood Pressure",main = "BP by Second MD Assessment")
boxplot(BloodPressure~FinalDecision,data = df_hosp,names = c("Low","High"),ylab = "Blood Pressure",main = "BP by Final Decision")

# B. Histograms
# Visualize overall distributions of Frequency and Blood Pressure
hist(df_hosp$Frequency,breaks = seq(0,1,by=0.1),xlab = "Visit Frequency",main = "Histogram of Visit Frequency")
hist(df_hosp$BloodPressure,breaks = 8,xlab = "Blood Pressure",main = "Histogram of Blood Pressure")

#Task 3 - Interpretation and Discussion
# 2-3 paragraphs addressing:
# How blood pressure varies with each Doctor's assessment and the final decision:

# Any notable patterns or outliers in the histograms:

# Potential clinical implications or limitations of this made up data:

# How handling of NA values affected your analysis:
